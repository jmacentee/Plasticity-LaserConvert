[TOPO] Processing 44 faces
[TOPO] Complex shape detected (44 faces), extracting ALL vertices from all face bounds
[TOPO] Extracted 84 unique vertices
[TOPO] Vertex ranges: X[-5.8,44.6] Y[-55.1,8.6] Z[5.4,36.9]
[TOPO] Computed dimensions: 50.4 x 63.7 x 31.5
[TOPO] Thin dimension detected from face separation: 2.9mm
[TOPO] Adjusted dimensions: 2.9 x 50.4 x 63.7
[FILTER] KCBox: dimensions [2.9, 50.4, 63.7] - PASS
[TRANSFORM] Thin dimension: 33.4,-6.3,33.9 -> 33.7,-5.4,34.3 (1.0mm)
[TRANSFORM] Normalizing edge to X-axis: angle=56.2ø
[SVG] KCBox: Computing rotation from 8 vertices in thin faces
[SVG] KCBox: Z range [-35.9, 22.1] (range=58.0), using all 84 vertices for projection
[SVG] KCBox: After rotation - X:[-0.5,34.4] Y:[-45.2,-20.4]
[SVG] KCBox: Complex shape but face only has 4 vertices, using full projection outline
[SVG] KCBox: Using top 25% of geometry: 32 vertices (Z >= 7.6)
[SVG] KCBox: After 2D projection and dedup: 29 unique points
[SVG] KCBox: Using perimeter ordering for 29 complex points
[SVG] KCBox: Generated outline path
