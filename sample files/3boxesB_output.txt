[TOPO] Processing 6 faces
[TOPO] Found pair of faces with separation: 3.0mm
[TOPO] Extracted 8 unique vertices
[TOPO] Vertex ranges: X[-85.0,85.0] Y[-82.0,28.2] Z[0.0,3.0]
[TOPO] Computed dimensions: 170.0 x 110.2 x 3.0
[TOPO] Thin dimension detected from face separation: 3.0mm
[TOPO] Adjusted dimensions: 3.0 x 110.2 x 170.0

[TOPO] Processing 6 faces
[TOPO] Found pair of faces with separation: 3.0mm
[TOPO] Extracted 8 unique vertices
[TOPO] Vertex ranges: X[-77.9,77.9] Y[-120.3,-46.7] Z[0.0,150.0]
[TOPO] Computed dimensions: 155.8 x 73.6 x 150.0
[TOPO] WARNING: Small face separation (3.0mm) but large Z dimension (150.0mm) - faces may not be parallel!
[TOPO] This suggests the face pair is not the actual thin pair. Using all vertices instead.
[TOPO] Recomputed with all faces: 155.8 x 73.6 x 150.0
[TOPO] Thin dimension detected from face separation: 3.0mm
