[TOPO] Processing 22 faces
[TOPO] Complex shape detected (22 faces), extracting ALL vertices from all face bounds
[TOPO] Extracted 40 unique vertices
[TOPO] Vertex ranges: X[82.0,85.0] Y[-82.0,82.0] Z[78.0,150.0]
[TOPO] Computed dimensions: 3.0 x 164.0 x 72.0
[TOPO] WARNING: Small face separation (2.0mm) but large Z dimension (72.0mm) - faces may not be parallel!
[TOPO] This suggests the face pair is not the actual thin pair. Using all vertices instead.
[TOPO] Recomputed with all faces: 3.0 x 164.0 x 72.0
[TOPO] Thin dimension detected from face separation: 2.0mm
[TOPO] Adjusted dimensions: 2.0 x 72.0 x 164.0
[FILTER] RightWall: dimensions [2.0, 72.0, 164.0] - FAIL
No thin solids found.
