[TOPO] Processing 14 faces
[TOPO] Found pair of faces with separation: 3.0mm
[TOPO] Extracted 24 unique vertices
[TOPO] Vertex ranges: X[-77.9,77.9] Y[-60.1,13.5] Z[0.0,150.0]
[TOPO] Computed dimensions: 155.8 x 73.6 x 150.0
[TOPO] WARNING: Small face separation (3.0mm) but large Z dimension (150.0mm) - faces may not be parallel!
[TOPO] This suggests the face pair is not the actual thin pair. Using all vertices instead.
[TOPO] Recomputed with all faces: 155.8 x 73.6 x 150.0
[TOPO] Thin dimension detected from face separation: 3.0mm
[TOPO] Adjusted dimensions: 3.0 x 150.0 x 155.8
[FILTER] KBox: dimensions [3.0, 150.0, 155.8] - PASS
[TRANSFORM] Thin dimension: -29.4,-35.1,150.0 -> -28.2,-37.9,150.0 (3.0mm)
[TRANSFORM] Normalizing edge to X-axis: angle=24.6ø
[SVG] KBox: Z range [19.7, 22.7] (range=3.0), using all 24 vertices for projection
[SVG] KBox: After rotation - X:[-94.7,75.3] Y:[-0.0,150.0]
[EXTRACT] ExtractFaceWithHoles: face has 1 bounds
[EXTRACT] Bound 0 has 12 vertices, bbox 154.5x70.9 (area=10949.8): (-76.6,-60.1,0.0), (-76.6,-60.1,150.0), (77.9,10.8,0.0), (77.9,10.8,145.0)...
[EXTRACT] Identified bound 0 as outer loop (largest area=10949.8)
[EXTRACT] Returning 12 outer verts and 0 hole loops
[SVG] KBox: Extracted outer loop with 12 vertices from face bounds
[SVG] KBox: Generated outline from 12 outline points
