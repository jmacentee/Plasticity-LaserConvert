Processing with thickness=3mm, tolerance=0.5mm (range: 2.5-3.5mm)
Found 1 solids
[TOPO] Processing 22 faces
[TOPO] Face pairs near target thickness (3mm):
[TOPO]   Faces 0-6: sep=3.0mm, alignment=1.00
[TOPO]   Faces 1-3: sep=3.0mm, alignment=1.00
[TOPO]   Faces 6-7: sep=3.0mm, alignment=1.00
[TOPO]   Faces 10-11: sep=3.0mm, alignment=1.00
[TOPO]   Faces 14-17: sep=3.0mm, alignment=1.00
[TOPO] Found face pair matching target thickness: separation=3.0mm (target=3mm)
[TOPO] Complex shape detected (22 faces), extracting ALL vertices from all face bounds
[TOPO] Extracted 40 unique vertices
[TOPO] Vertex ranges: X[82.0,85.0] Y[-82.0,82.0] Z[78.0,150.0]
[TOPO] Computed dimensions: 3.0 x 164.0 x 72.0
[TOPO] WARNING: Small face separation (3.0mm) but large Z dimension (72.0mm) - faces may not be parallel!
[TOPO] This suggests the face pair is not the actual thin pair. Using all vertices instead.
[TOPO] Recomputed with all faces: 3.0 x 164.0 x 72.0
[FILTER] RightWall: dimensions [3.0, 164.0, 72.0] - PASS (target thickness: 3mm)
